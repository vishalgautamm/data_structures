# Data Structures
Implementing data structures using javascript

## Linked Lists

 - Linked lists store a sequential collection of elements
 - Each element consists of a node that stores the element itself and also a reference (also known as a pointer or link) that points to the next element.
  
## Binary Search Tree

- A binary search tree is a binary tree, but it only allows you to store nodes with lesser values on the left side and nodes with greater values on the right side.
  
## Hash Table

- Hashing consists of finding a value in a data structure in the shortest time possible.
- When we use a hash function, we already know which position the value is in, so we can simply retrieve it.
- A hash function is a function that given a key, and will return an address in the table where the value is.

# Algorithms

## Merge Sort

###Pseudo Code
- Recursively sort first half of the input array
- Recursively sort second half of the input array
- Merge two sorted sublists into one

### Analysis: Running Time
- The Merge Sort has a running time of N*log(N)
